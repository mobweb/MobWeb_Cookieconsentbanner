# MobWeb_Cookieconsentbanner extension for Magento

A simple Magento 1 extension that displays a simple cookie consent banner on every page until the user accepts the «Essential» cookies. You can also display checkboxes for additional cookie categories, but you'll have to implement the actual enabling or disabling of the cookies yourself.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
